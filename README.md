Employee Placement & Salary Prediction
📌 Overview

This project is about predicting whether a student/employee will get placed and estimating their possible salary using Machine Learning. The idea behind this project is to explore how data analysis and predictive models can support HR decisions and help organizations understand placement and salary trends.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information such as:

Education qualification

Test scores

Work experience

Salary details (for those already placed)

I worked on cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing it for machine learning models.

🔎 Approach

Data Preprocessing

Removed missing or irrelevant values.

Encoded categorical data into numerical format.

Scaled features for better model performance.

Model Building

Used algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Trees.

Trained models using placement and salary data.

Model Evaluation

Checked performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

▶️ How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/placement-salary-prediction.git


Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Python script:

python placement_model.py


Or open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook data_cleaning.ipynb

📈 Results

The model successfully predicts whether a student/employee will get placed.

It also estimates the expected salary based on education and experience.

Example:
Input → Education: Masters, Experience: 3 years
Output → Predicted Salary: ₹6,50,000

✅ Conclusion

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Building and testing machine learning models

Visualizing datasets to understand trends

Applying ML in real-world HR and placement scenarios

This project helped me understand how machine learning can support decision-making in hiring and employee management.
